# Personal Web Page

I personally do not like `JavaScript` but wanted to build a refined yet simple web page. To address interactive features, I am using [htmx](https://htmx.org)
complemented by an [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) server on the backend.

Most of the work has been quite manual, I added the configurations to the NGINX web server used to host the website.
